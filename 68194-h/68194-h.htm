<h2 class="nobreak">THE STORY OF THE PLAY</h2>

<p>Miss Boltwood, a despotic spinster, is persuaded to join a band of
ladies who have sworn to give up tea and all taxed articles till
the Revolutionary War is over. The tea habit is too strong for Miss
Boltwood and she drinks it secretly. Her niece, Betty, discovers this
and uses the information to compel her aunt to consent to her (Betty’s)
engagement to the young minuteman, William Dickinson.</p>

<p>Miss Boltwood also has a lover, the Tory, Judge Ingram, whom she has
kept dangling for years. When he joins the Patriot cause and she hears
the (false) report that he has been arrested as a spy, she champions
him and finds that she loves him; she becomes an ardent Patriot
also—all this just as he has decided that their <i>friendship</i> is
ideal! Mandy, who is a privileged character, furnishes much fun.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>SCENE.—<i>The living-room of</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Boltwood’s</span> <i>home.
There are doors to</i> <span class="allsmcap">L.</span> <i>and</i> <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>, <i>a
closed window near</i> <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>, <i>a fireplace with fire near</i>
<span class="allsmcap">C.</span> <i>and over it a cupboard that locks; a tea table, four
straight chairs, a high winged chair or settle, a mirror, furnishings
of a colonial tea table, a black cat (toy), etc.</i></p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Mandy</span> <i>is discovered on stage. She pokes fire, looks into
kettle, stumbles over cat by the hearth.</i>)</p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Mandy.</span> Dere’s dat cat agin! Here you, Salem, git out from
under Mandy’s feet ’fore I break my neck or yours! Black imp o’ Satan!
(<i>The cat is supposed to spit.</i>) He spits! I pray you, spit not at
poor old Mandy, please, Mr. Cat! Oh, you looks a very witch cat! Good
Salem! Good pussy!</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Pets the cat.</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Betty Boltwood</span> <i>in afternoon dress but with an
apron on</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> Mandy, aunt bids you assist me with the porcelain
against the tea-drinking this afternoon. Fetch the linen towel and the
tray.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandy.</span> Yes, missy. Here dey is.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Mandy</span> <i>gets towel and tray and she and</i> <span class="smcap">Betty</span>
<i>wipe the dishes and arrange them on the tea table</i>.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> (<i>holding up cream pitcher</i>). I like well this tea
set, Mandy. ’Twas a most pleasing gift that aunt’s cousin fetched her
from China. She surely hath a vast love for tea. ’Tis almost a carnal
weakness!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandy.</span> True, missy. You’ aunt do love tea most ’stravagantly,
an’ cats too! (<i>Looks scornfully at</i> <span class="smcap">Salem</span>.) A true sign
she will never marry. But Missy Boltwood am so sperity de mens am
’fraid of her, mebbe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> (<i>as they set the table</i>). Aunt is too
strong-willed and—and—managing to obey any man. Heard you not that
when a girl she was betrothed to Judge Ingram, but could not abide the
thought of marriage?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandy.</span> Lawsy, Miss Betty! An’ such friends as dey is, too! De
Judge am a Tory. Is dat de reason Missy Boltwood ain’t no patriarch
like mos’ of de Hartfield ladies?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> Nay, Mandy, ’tis because aunt lived so many years in
England. She thinks there need be no quarrel between the Colonies and
the king. Could she but hear William Dickinson defend the cause of our
independence——</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">(<i>There is the sound of a wagon driven rapidly.</i> <span class="smcap">Mandy</span>
<i>runs to the window dish in hand</i>.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandy.</span> Why, dere’s you’ William Dickinson now, a-dashin’ by in
de wagon!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> (<i>darting also to the window</i>). Where? I see only
dust. Looked he not up at the window, Mandy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandy.</span> No, Miss Betty. He was racin’ dose colts over de groun’!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> (<i>pouting</i>). And we have not met in two long days!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandy</span> (<i>earnestly</i>). Miss Betty, if you’ aunt knew how
lovery you is wid dat William Dickinson, she would prison you in you’
chamber. You know well she can’t ’bide de Dickinsons ’count of de old
quarrel ’tween de famblies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> True, but naught can be said against William. He is the
bravest and handsomest minuteman in the company, and——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandy.</span> Sh, missy! I hears you’ aunt on de stairs.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Lavinia Boltwood</span>, <i>handsomely gowned</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Cease your chattering, Mandy. Fetch me the egg cakes
and the macaroons from the great cupboard.</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Mandy</span>.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty.</span> With your permission, aunt, I will go abroad to take
the air. ’Tis too beauteous a day to remain within.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Takes off her apron.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Then I pray you go down to the Meadow Road and buy me
some sage cheese from Mrs. Abiel Dickinson. Should you chance to see
young William, chatter not with him. ’Tis not seemly for maidens to
talk overmuch with men.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mandy</span> <i>with a plate of cakes in each hand.
She stands listening with the plates slanted so that the cakes are in
danger of falling off. She now grins knowingly at</i> <span class="smcap">Betty</span>
<i>behind</i> <span class="smcap">Miss B.’s</span> <i>back</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> (<i>demurely</i>). I will heed your counsel, aunt.
’Twill be best to wear my new bonnet. The old one is sadly shabby.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">(<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Betty</span>, <i>who returns in a moment and puts her
bonnet on before the mirror</i>.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Mandy, you stupid, lay down the plates and put the
teapot to warm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandy</span> (<i>putting teapot on the hearth</i>). Is you goin’ to
give old Mandy jess a leetle tea to-day, missy? I knows tea is powerful
’spensive. Why so, missy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Because the Parliament taxes tea. Have you no
remembrance of the Boston Tea Party, more than a year agone, when the
tea was thrown overboard in Boston Harbor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandy.</span> Yes, missy, I recommembers, an’ lots of lady patriarchs
stopped drinkin’ tea den. Missy Abiel Dickinson she drink “Liberty
Tea,” an’ I helps her pick de raspberry leaves las’ summer——</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Knocker sounds.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> There is the knocker, Mandy. Do you attend the door.
(<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Mandy</span>. <i>She ushers in</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Strong</span>,
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Cowles</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Adams</span>.) Good-afternoon,
Mrs. Strong; good-afternoon, Mrs. Cowles; good-afternoon, Mrs. Adams. I
hope I see you all well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> I am in my usual state of good health, thank you, Miss
Boltwood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> Save for a slight rheum, I am enjoying the blessing of
health, thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> Thank you kindly, Miss Boltwood, I am as well as can
be expected.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Lay aside your cloaks, ladies. Mandy, assist the
ladies.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>They remove their wraps.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Did I not see your niece Betty flitting through the
lane as I came by?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> It may be. I sent her on an errand to Mrs. Abiel
Dickinson’s. ’Tis a safe walk to the Meadow Road.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>She moves to the fireplace and makes the tea.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> (<i>looking meaningly at the others</i>).
Laws-a-massy! Is she throwing the girl at William’s head?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> Sh! She does not know how enamored the young people
are. When she learns it—poor Betty!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> (<i>turning from the fireplace</i>). I pray you,
ladies, draw up to the table ere the tea be cold. (<i>They seat
themselves.</i> <span class="smcap">Mandy</span> <i>brings the teapot and places it
before</i> <span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> <span class="smcap">Mandy</span> <i>looks longingly at the
tea, sniffs it, and licks her lips behind their backs. The ladies pour
the tea into their saucers and blow it noisily, crooking their little
fingers as they raise the saucers to their lips. At a sign from</i>
<span class="smcap">Miss B.</span>, <span class="smcap">Mandy</span> <i>exits</i>.) ’Tis a pity I have none
of my rose conserve to give you. I sent it all to my friends in England
by the Christmas packet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Your conserve is marvelous, Miss Boltwood. The receipt
is a secret, I presume.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> A family heirloom, Mrs. Strong. Pray tell me, ladies,
if the tea be sufficiently brewed. I can assure you ’tis prime Bohea
and no “Liberty Tea”!</p>

<p class="center">(<i>She laughs a little scornfully.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> ’Tis of an elegant strength and ’tis an elegant tea. I
feel certain no duty was paid on it. Was it honestly smuggled, my dear
Miss Boltwood?</p>

<p class="center">(<i>All laugh.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Indeed it was, and through Judge Ingram too. A poor
Tory he!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> Mayhap the good man will become a patriot in time.
(<i>Helps herself to a cake.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> We ought to scorn to use anything taxed, as the king
hath used the Colonies so unjustly! Still, ’twould be a hardship to
give up the tea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Well, I am neither Tory nor patriot; so I drink
smuggled tea, and shall drink it till I am under better advisement.
Pray take of the candied cherries, Mrs. Strong. May I fill your cup,
Mrs. Cowles? (<i>The knocker sounds.</i> <span class="smcap">Mandy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></span> <i>passes
through from</i> <span class="allsmcap">L.</span> <i>to</i> <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> <i>She ushers
in</i> <span class="smcap">Judge Ingram</span>, <i>who carries a newspaper. All rise and
curtsey.</i>) Good-afternoon, Stephen Ingram.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge.</span> Good-afternoon, Miss Lavinia. Pray do not let me
interrupt your tea-drinking, ladies. I but stopped in passing to
leave Miss Boltwood’s Boston <i>Gazette</i>. The news is recent—but
four days old—and of great moment. (<i>He opens the paper.</i>) The
Provincial Congress at Lexington is adjourned. ’Tis said General Gage
is resolved to crush the rebellion. (<i>Ladies show excitement.</i>) He
has now in Boston four thousand disciplined men. I fear me there will
be war, long and bloody, before our king is master once more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> Master! Never again in these colonies!</p>

<p class="center">(<i>The ladies rise in indignation.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Our minutemen will match with any British soldiers!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> We women can assist our men, if it comes to a war
against injustice!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span> (<i>laughing</i>). Ladies, ladies! Such ardent patriots,
and yet drinking tea!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> (<i>firmly</i>). If war is coming and our men must
fight, I, too, can make some sacrifice. I will give up tea and all
taxed articles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> And I!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> I, too! Come, Miss Boltwood, join our league. It shall
be named from your house where ’twas born, “The Boltwood Band.” Come,
now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Nay, I am no patriot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All.</span> Come, come; no denial.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>They join hands and place hers in theirs.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> This shall be our oath: “We swear to give up tea and
all taxed articles till the war be over.” Now, in unison.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> (<i>including</i> <span class="smcap">Miss B.</span>). We swear to give up
tea and all taxed articles till the war be over.</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Judge</span> <i>looks on amused</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span> (<i>rising</i>). Well, ladies, now that you are all
committed to raspberry leaves and linsey-woolsey, I will go. (<i>There
is the sound of a galloping horse, then excited voices of men. All rise

grave.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge.</span> ’Tis as I feared. The rash minutemen have fired on the
king’s troops and war has begun. Day before yesterday there was a fight
at Lexington and Concord——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Tell us, man! Who was victorious?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge.</span> The rebels stood their ground, ’tis reported, and the
king’s troops retreated, but not because of defeat——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> Did the Regulars retreat to Boston?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge.</span> Yes, and I fear it was a rout at the last. Owing to the
firing of the rebels from behind walls and trees, the British became
panic-stricken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> (<i>excitedly</i>). Hurroo for our brave men! ’Tis
glorious that they routed the trained troops!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> But why did the fighting begin out at Lexington,
Stephen? ’Tis a good ten miles from Boston.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge.</span> General Gage was hoping to destroy the ammunition
at Concord. In some way his plan was learned, and Paul Revere, the
goldsmith, rode all night warning the countryside. When the Regulars
came, the minutemen were ready.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> (<i>compassionately</i>). Did many men fall?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge.</span> ’Tis reported a hundred minutemen and nearly three
hundred of the king’s troops.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Well, thanks for that! Each minuteman, it seems,
convoyed three Britishers with him out of existence!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> My dear Mrs. Strong! Feel you no pity?</p>

(<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span>, <span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs.

is a matter I would discuss with you. Should the war prove serious I
may return to England. I would Betty were well settled, for she is
over-impulsive and filled with romance. You are a Tory and will fare
well when the patriots are punished, as they doubtless will be. Why
should you not marry the child? ’Twould be a most excellent arrangement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge.</span> Marry Betty! Impossible! How can you suggest such
a thing? The girl would not abide one old enough to be her father.
Besides, there is an obstacle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> An obstacle! Pray what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge.</span> Yourself, Lavinia. My heart is still yours though you
cruelly condemn me to single living. I am ever hoping that you may
reconsider your decision.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Say no more, Stephen. I thought the old flame had
died for lack of fuel. I like you well in friendship, but as I have
declared, I will not be at the bidding of any man. I will not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span> (<i>sadly</i>). As you will, Lavinia. But if you consent
not to my happiness, at least do not mar Betty’s. She and young William
Dickinson are lovers. He is a fine, upright youth. Let her marry where
she will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> (<i>horrified</i>). What? Betty philandering with
William Dickinson! The sly minx! She shall never marry any Dickinson,
